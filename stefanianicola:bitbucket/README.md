BTC Converter, it contains a table where the API is consumed and a calculator where the value of the coin and bitcoin can be converted back and forth.

Dashboard, it contains a candlestick chart made with the plugin Trading-vue-js. I could not consume the information as I had a cross origin error when I wanted to consume the API. So I left you with test data.
